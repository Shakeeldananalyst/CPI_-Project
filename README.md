# CPI_-Project

This project analyzes India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2017 to 2023, focusing on inflation trends across categories like food, energy, and healthcare. Key events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price fluctuations are explored to assess their impact on inflation. Python and visualizations are used to identify major contributors and trends driving inflation.
