# CPI_-Project

This project analyzes India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2017 to 2023, focusing on inflation trends across categories like food, energy, and healthcare. Key events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price fluctuations are explored to assess their impact on inflation. Python and visualizations are used to identify major contributors and trends driving inflation.

Follwing were some problem statements.

1. Contribution of Broader Categories to CPI
Combine similar categories (e.g., Meals, Beverages â†’ Food).
Aggregate and identify the highest-contributing category.
Use pie or bar chart to visualize contributions.
2. Y-o-Y CPI Inflation Trend (2017-2023)
Calculate YoY percentage change in combined rural + urban inflation.
Plot a line graph to highlight the highest inflation year.
Briefly explain the highest inflation year based on economic events (e.g., COVID-19).
3. Food Price Inflation (Nov 2023 vs Last 12 Months)
Analyze month-on-month inflation for broader food categories.
Identify key food items contributing to the inflation spike.
Plot line graphs for food category trends and absolute changes.
4. Impact of COVID-19 on Inflation
Compare pre- and post-March 2020 inflation rates in healthcare, food, and essential services.
Use line or stacked bar charts to show inflation trends before/after the pandemic.
5. Oil Price Fluctuations (2021-2023)
Analyze imported oil price changes and CPI inflation.
Perform correlation analysis to find categories most affected by oil prices (e.g., fuel, transportation).
Visualize with scatter plots or correlation heatmaps.
